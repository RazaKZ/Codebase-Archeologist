Create a complete, production-ready codebase for "Codebase Archeologist" as described above.

IMPLEMENT ALL PARTS 1-7 in this order:

PART 1: Project structure and setup
PART 2: Multi-agent analysis engine  
PART 3: React dashboard with React Flow
PART 4: FastAPI backend with Snyk/Repo Prompt integration
PART 5: Docker + deployment config
PART 6: Documentation and pitch materials
PART 7: 48-hour checklist

USE THESE EXACT TECHNOLOGIES:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + React Flow + Zustand
- Backend: FastAPI + Python 3.11 + LangGraph + NetworkX
- Database: SQLAlchemy + SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
- APIs: Snyk Code (free tier), Gemini/Code Wiki (free tier)
- Local: Repo Prompt MCP, AST parsing
- Deployment: Vercel + Railway

CONSTRAINTS:
1. 100% free tools only
2. Must work without internet (fallback modes)
3. Judges must be impressed in first 30 seconds
4. Complete submission package by end

Make it production-grade, scalable, and hackathon-winning.
