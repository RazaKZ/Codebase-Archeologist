# Codebase Archeologist - Hackathon Pitch

## 🎯 The Problem

Developers waste countless hours trying to understand legacy codebases:
- "What does this function do?"
- "What breaks if I delete this?"
- "Where are the circular dependencies?"
- "Is this code even used?"

## 💡 Our Solution

**Codebase Archeologist** is a multi-agent AI system that:
1. **Maps** your entire codebase structure
2. **Understands** what code actually does (not just what it's named)
3. **Predicts** impact before you make changes
4. **Visualizes** dependencies in an interactive graph

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Analysis Engine
- **Repo Analyzer**: Extracts AST from any codebase
- **Dependency Mapper**: Builds dependency graphs, finds dead code
- **Business Logic Extractor**: AI-powered code understanding
- **Impact Analyzer**: Predicts consequences of changes
- **Orchestrator**: Manages workflow and streams progress

### 2. Interactive Visualization
- React Flow-based dependency graphs
- Real-time analysis progress
- Click to explore relationships
- Color-coded risk indicators

### 3. Production-Ready
- Works offline (fallback modes)
- 100% free tools
- Fast and scalable
- Beautiful, modern UI

## 🏆 Why We'll Win

1. **Complete Solution**: Not just a demo - full production system
2. **Impressive Tech**: Multi-agent AI, graph analysis, real-time updates
3. **Great UX**: Judges will be impressed in first 30 seconds
4. **Scalable**: Handles large codebases efficiently
5. **Free**: Uses only free-tier APIs

## 📊 Demo Flow

1. **Enter Repo URL** → Start analysis
2. **Watch Progress** → Real-time agent updates
3. **Explore Graph** → Interactive dependency visualization
4. **Ask "What breaks?"** → Get impact analysis
5. **See Insights** → Dead code, circular deps, hotspots

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + React Flow
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11 + LangGraph + NetworkX
- **AI**: Gemini API (free tier) + Snyk Code
- **Deployment**: Vercel + Railway
